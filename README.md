# simple-typst-thesis

This template defines a frontpage with a centered title and author informations, and an optional logo.

Each page of the main body has a custom header. The header shows what the current page is about. It does this in three ways:
- If the current page has a main heading, the header uses that.
- If not, the header combines the last main and secondary headings from previous pages.
- Sometimes, there are no secondary headings on previous pages. In that case, the header only uses the last main heading.
